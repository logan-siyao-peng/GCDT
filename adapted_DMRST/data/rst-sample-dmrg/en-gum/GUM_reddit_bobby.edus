Why very few actually Beat Bobby Flay .
While it seems suspicious that Bobby wins so many of the competitions
( leading many to think
that the show is rigged ) ,
I have a feeling
that Bobby 's record is a product of selective casting .
To explain :
Remember when Anne Burrell challenged Bobby to a cheesecake battle ,
and won ?
Anne admitted
it ’s not her favorite dish ,
but she knows
that Bobby sucks at desserts .
Did n't you think to yourself at the time ,
`` Why has n't anyone else thought to do that ? ``
I bet they have .
I bet lots of people have .
But to ensure that Bobby maintains a favorable batting average
( and therefore looks good
/ stays happy on the show ) ,
the producers ask what chefs intend to cook as their signature dish in the audition process ,
and then only pick challengers
who either a ) , are going to cook something
that 's already in Bobby 's wheelhouse
( how many times have we seen that happen ? ) ,
or b ) , are going to cook something unique ,
but it 's an irregular
( or just plain stupid )
version of that unique thing .
Given that
when confronted with a dish unfamiliar to him ,
Bobby always prepares a straightforward version ,
Bobby 's earnest dish will usually win out over the platter of WHUT put out by the challenger .
Do n’t take my word for it ,
just watch the show .
Usually
when the challenger announces their dish
you think to yourself ,
“ oh Bobby ’s screwed on this one , ”
but then immediately they cut to that interview
where a smiling , imbecilic contender says ,
“ My version of ________ has ...
[ some looney goddamn ingredient or technique that does n’t belong in that dish ] . ”
And then they are oh - so - surprised at the end of the show
when their inane concoction gets clobbered by Mr. Flay .
BTW if you ’re still doubtful ,
the producers HAVE to know the secret in advance .
There ’s no way they ’re stopping production
while a P.A. runs out
to buy liver & onions .
Which brings me back to Anne Burrell and her cheesecake .
Celebrity chefs win against Bobby more often
because they are who they are ,
and they can cook whatever they want to .
The producers are just happy to have them on the show ,
and when Bobby loses to them
it does n't look as bad .
This also illuminates why we so often see judges
who themselves have a background in whatever the signature dish is .
If the producers know what the challenger is going to cook ,
they can bring in judges
who know
how it 's supposed to be cooked
( and also importantly , know
that it 's not supposed to be cooked in whatever godforsaken manner
than the challenger plans ) .
One final thing :
Though I ’m inclined to believe
that Bobby does n’t actually know what the signature dish will be
( even though the producers do ) ,
I would n’t be too terribly surprised
if one of his assistants or sous - chefs has been told the dish
and has “ seeded ” Bobby ’s pantry with ideas .
I ’m sure it ’s always well - stocked ,
but c’m on ...
it ca n’t hold more than a fraction of what ’s in the supermarket .
So
when Bobby looks
and sees a bottle of , say , pomegranate molasses
that ’s not normally there ,
that ’s his clue .
“ Oh yeah , a gastrique would work really well here . ”
This might seem a bit shady ,
but it does n’t conflict directly with anything
the show tells you about
how it works .
And that , my friends , is “ reality ” TV .
The producers most definitely know .
How else do they always find judges
that are experts in that type of cuisine
to judge the competition ?
While I do think Bobby Flay is actually that good
( regardless of how cocky he can appear ) ,
I do agree with you
that the competitor tends to be their own worst enemy .
I feel like they always go overboard with their dish
to try and wow the judges
that they forget
they simply just need to beat Bobby ’s dish .
Bobby takes the dish
and just makes sure all the flavors and textures are there
while the competitor tries to make the dish more unique and their own .
It rarely works .
I 've always thought of Bobby Flay as an arrogant douche ,
but the tiramisu episode of BBF confirmed
that he is a douche .
In the middle of the tiramisu challenge , he decided to make 4 cheeseburgers from scratch just for fun
to eat during .
Fuck that .
That was so disrespectful to the challenger pastry chef .
so happy Amanda won though !
love when I see people / places from Austin on FN : )
From binge watching this show the past week ,
it ’s clear that Bobby has advance knowledge of what he might face .
Recall that Iron Chef also was n’t a total surprise as to the featured ingredient .
PS -
Good analysis from OP .
Bobby has never made anything
that the competition challenges him too .
He just makes a completely different dish
and calls it a Southwest version of whatever he was supposed to make .
bobby flay is an iron chef for a reason .
he is going up against mostly home cooks or restaurant chefs .
while i do agree
that they do selective casting ,
which all shows do anyways for entertainment purposes ,
i do believe
that he is that good .
The producers know ,
but I do n't think
they 're actively try and push the scales against Bobby .
They want the competetors to cook their own signature dish
because that 's interesting
- it 's the premise of the show .
The best that some `` average `` chef has to offer vs some side dish
produced by a master chef .
When you 're a celebrity chef ,
you do n't really have a single singular dish .
You can cook everything ,
and maybe specialize in a few fields .
So when master chefs go against Bobby ,
they can just whip out something
they know
they 're probably better than him at .
